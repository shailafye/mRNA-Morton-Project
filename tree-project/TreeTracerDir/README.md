This directory contains the main TreeTracer class that will use an inputted Newick tree file 
and a list of corresponding FASTA sequences to generate a data structure using 
Phylo package in Biopython. This tree structure will be iterated across and functions from treetracer_functions.py
will be called. Matrix class is used to encapsulate the output and apply further analysis
functions on the output base pair changes.

Make sure Biopython package is installed to properly run treetracer.py
