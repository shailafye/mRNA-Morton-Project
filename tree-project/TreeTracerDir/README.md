This directory contains the main TreeTracer class that will use an inputted Newick tree file 
and a list of corresponding FASTA sequences to generate a data structure using 
Phylo package in Biopython. This tree structure will be iterated across and functions from treetracer_functions.py
will be called. Matrix class is used to encapsulate the output and apply further analysis
functions on the output base pair changes.
